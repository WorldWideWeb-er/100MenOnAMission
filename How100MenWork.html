                <button class="accordion">Is my contribution tax deductible? How do I get my tax forms?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Yes, your contribution is tax deductible unless a cause that is not a 501(c)(3) is voted on by the majority. Checks are written directly to the local organization NOT to 100+ Men on a Mission. Your tax forms will be sent to you directly from the organization that receives your contribution. PLEASE NOTE: Any sponsored non-profit is not allowed to create, sell or distribute a list with your contact information. They are not allowed to solicit you for further contributions. If this were to happen, the organization would no longer be considered at future meetings.</p>

                <button class="accordion">How is the organization that receives the donation chosen?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>A member who has signed the commitment form can put the name of a local organization into the box for a random drawing. The organizers of the meeting will collect names of organizations from the participants as they arrive. Please note: you do not have to bring the name of a local organization, though it is encouraged. At random, three organizations will be selected from the box. The members who wrote down each name will be asked to come up and give a short 5 minute presentation as to why their chosen organization should receive the donation. A 5 minute question and answer period follows.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The goal of the 100+ Men on a Mission organization is to make a large donation on behalf of the whole group. We want to be able to support this endeavor and give $10,000+ dollars at a time to make a large impact in our community, with each member's donation being part of the larger donation.</p>
