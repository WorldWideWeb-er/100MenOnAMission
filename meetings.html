            <h1>How long do the meetings last?</h1>
            <p>Meetings are intended to be very short, generally lasting no longer than 45 minutes. However, we are planning on having a social time before each meeting to get to know other members, answer questions about the organization, and thank those of you who want to serve the community. We also encourage members to stay and enjoy dinner afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Of course you can! However, in order to vote they will need to sign up prior to their first meeting. They can accomplish this by simply arriving at the meeting a few minutes early.</p>

                    <p>You can send a blank, signed check with a trusted friend to the meeting. They will write in the name of the charity that is chosen and give it to the organizers on your behalf. They do not vote on your behalf. We can only count the votes of members who are present.

                        Or...
                        <br>
                        After the meeting is over, members who were not able to attend can check the website or call the organizers to find out which charity was selected. You can then write your check and mail it to the organizers, within one week of the meeting date, and we will send it to the charity on your behalf.
