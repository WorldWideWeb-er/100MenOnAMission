But a devastating bacteria infected the cut and made its way into Trisha's bloodstream. Serious complications arose that ultimately led to the amputation of both of Trisha's hands and feet

As part of getting to know Trisha's story in more detail, it became apparent that she could use some help with some home improvements. In stepped the 100 Men Project Team! Here is Trisha's take on some jobs well done. If you would like to learn more about Trisha's journey, please click here.</p>

                                <p>An awesome group of men swarmed upon my home for two Thursdays in a row, left all kinds of greatness in their wake, and stole all my cookies! O.K., I actually had to force the cookies on them because they were way too polite to take too many otherwise...</p>
                                
                                <p>100 Men On A Mission is a group of men, some young and just starting out, some retired, some in the middle, but all with BIG hearts to assist the DSM community in various ways. As a group, they are able to do so much more than any of them could do on their own, and so their group was formed. Helping me out with all my handyman type tasks is case in point! I had a very large list of things needing done around my house. So, the offer from 100 Men On A Mission to help me out was such a blessing! Cole came both Thursdays as well and worked from my home while being here to answer questions they may have, and also finishing off my ramp.</p>
                                
                                <p>Mike, whom my good friend, Al, has been working with from Meals From The Heartland for my walk, is part of this group. Al and Mike know each other from Kiwanis Miracle League. And Mike is also a former co-worker of mine back when we were both new to Norwest in the late 80's. Now sing "It's a small world after all..."! Al and his buddy Roger also came to help on the second Thursday.</p>
                                
                                <p>The guys were INCREDIBLE! They accomplished tasks such as planting vines on trellises in my front yard, placing flower hangers in my bedroom and office, hanging a TV and ceiling fan, installing a Nest thermostat in my home, installing a Nest keypad on my front door, installing a remote keypad for my garage, hanging curtains in all rooms, assembling and installing a bookcase in my office and shelf in my bathroom, and fixing my kitchen sink, literally!</p>
